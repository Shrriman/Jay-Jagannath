Shri Jagannath, the Lord of the Universe, is considered an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is worshipped in the form of Lord Krishna. With his large round eyes, a red mouth, black-colored divine face, and semi-formed arms, his appearance is quite distinctive. For this reason, some people call him “Adha Gadha Dian” (half-formed deity). His main temple is located in the south east direction of the city of Puri in Odisha. There, he is worshipped seated on the Ratna Singhasana (gem-studded throne) along with his elder brother Balabhadra, sister Subhadra, and the divine discus Sudarshan. Hence, Puri is counted among the four sacred dhams (holy pilgrimage sites) of India. Shri Jagannath is a symbol of pride for every Odia. His glory is world-renowned. Let us now understand the significance of his divine form.</p>

  <h2>Shri Jagannath: An Introduction to a Wonderful Form</h2>
  <p>
   There is a story behind the unique form of Lord Jagannath. It dates back to the Dwapara Yuga. One day, while Lord Krishna was resting, his two wives — Devi Rukmini and Devi Satyabhama — were sitting beside him. They wanted to know whose name the Lord would take first upon waking. They hoped he would call one of them first. However, as soon as Lord Krishna woke up, he first uttered the name of Radha.<br><br>

Now, Rukmini and Satyabhama had never heard the complete story of Radha and Krishna's eternal love. So, they went to Mother Rohini and requested her to narrate the story of Radha-Krishna's Rasaleela (divine dance of love). Mother Rohini feared that if Krishna and Balaram heard these past tales, they might be drawn back to Vrindavan again. So, she asked Devi Subhadra to stand guard at the door while she narrated the story. Rohini Devi then began describing the divine and priceless love story of Radha and Krishna.<br><br>

After a while, both Krishna and Balaram arrived at the spot. Subhadra, being so engrossed in the story, didn't notice their arrival. The tale was so sweet and mesmerizing that all three — Krishna, Balaram, and Subhadra — became deeply emotional and overwhelmed with divine love.<br><br>

At that moment, the great sage Devarshi Narada happened to pass by. Seeing the Lord and his siblings in such a divine state, he too was drawn toward them and came to witness their divine expressions. As Narada approached, Mother Rohini's eyes fell on the divine trio. Everyone present was deeply moved and enchanted by this extraordinary divine form. Sage Narada then requested the Lord that this divine form should be made visible to the entire world. In response, Lord Krishna declared that in the age of Kali Yuga, the three of them — Krishna, Balaram, and Subhadra — would be worshipped in this very divine form by the people of the world.<br><br>

So, calling Shri Jagannath “half-formed deity” is incorrect. His hand is not incomplete, it is unlimited, which has no limits. He has spread his arms to infinite distance to embrace everyone. He is complete within the incomplete, formless within the form. He has neither any beginning nor any end. This incompleteness of his gives him perfection. He is a divine symbol of unconditional love and supreme devotion Lord of the universe Shri Jagannath.</p>
  
    <h2>Shri Mandir: The Sacred Meeting Place of Devotees and the Divine</h2>
    <p>
    The main temple of Shri Jagannath located in Puri is known as "Shri Mandir" (Bada Deula). This temple is built on the Nilagiri mountain by the sea shore, and hence this place is also called Nilachal. According to ancient scriptures and Puranas, it is believed that there once stood a high mountain called Nilagiri. However, that mountain no longer exists. Due to the cycle of time (Kalachakra) and natural changes, it has vanished. The height of this temple is 65 meters (214 feet). It is constructed on approximately 400,000 square feet (37,000 square meters) of land in Puri. It is considered one of the tallest temples in India.<br><br>

At the top of this temple, there is a huge wheel called the Nilachakra. The flag flying over the Nilachakra is called the Patitapavana flag. There are four main gates surrounding the Shri Mandir for entry. The eastern gate is called Singhadwara, the western gate is called Byaghradwara, the northern gate is called Hastidwara, and the southern gate is called Ashwadwara.<br><br>

Inside the courtyard of Shri Mandir, there are a total of 13 smaller and larger temples. These temples are:-<br>

Shri Vimala Devi Temple<br>

Shri Lakshmi Devi Temple<br>

Shri Nrusingh Temple<br>

Shri Saraswati Temple<br>

Shri Ganesh Temple<br>

Shri Shiva Temple (Pataleshwar / Markandeshwar)<br>

Shri Surya Temple<br>
